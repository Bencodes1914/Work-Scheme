<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I started learning web development because I wanted to build my own websites and understand how the internet works. At first, it looked difficult with all the tags, attributes, and new words. But with practice, things started making sense.</p>


<h3>First Steps</h3>
<p>The first language I learned was HTML. It was fun to create headings, paragraphs, and insert images. The thrill of seeing something I typed appear in the browser was unmatched.</p>
<ul>
<li>Created my first “Hello World” page</li>
<li>Added images of my pets</li>
<li>Linked pages together</li>
</ul>


<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges was remembering all the tags and their purposes. Sometimes I forgot to close a tag, and the whole page would look broken. Debugging was frustrating but also taught me patience.</p>


<h4>Key Lesson Learned</h4>
<blockquote>“Every expert was once a beginner.”</blockquote>


<h5>Useful Resources</h5>
<p>I used free resources like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">MDN Web Docs</a> and <a href="https://w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>. I also watched YouTube tutorials and joined online forums to ask questions.</p>


<h6>Conclusion</h6>
<p>I am excited about the journey ahead. Next, I plan to learn CSS and JavaScript so I can make my websites look better and add interactivity.</p>
